>[!definition] Definition (Group)
>A **group** $(G,*)$ is a set $G$ with binary operation $*$ that satisfies the following axioms:
>1. **Closure axiom**: For all $a, b \in G$, we have $a * b \in G$.
>2. **Identity axiom**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for all $a \in G$, we have $$a * e = e * a = a.$$
>3. **Inverse axiom**: For all $a \in G$, there is some $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $$a * a^{-1} = a^{-1} * a = e.$$
>4.  **Associativity axiom**: For all $a, b, c \in G$, we have $$ a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c.$$
