As proved [[Functions#Onto, Onto-to-One and Bijection|here]], for two sets $S$ and $T$ if $S > T$ then there is no [[Functions#Onto, Onto-to-One and Bijection|one-to-one]] function from $S \to T$. This can be phrased in the form of the **pigeonhole principle**:

> If we put $n+1$ or more pigeons into $n$ pigeonholes, then there must be a pigeonhole containing more than one pigeon.

This may seem obvious but can use to form some interesting proofs. For example:

>[!example]
>Show that no matter how you place 5 points in a $1 \times 1$ square, at least two points will be at a distance of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ or closer.
>$\newline$
>First, divide the $1 \times 1$ square into quarters, so $4$ $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}$ squares. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, at least 2 points will be in the same $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}$ square. The maximum distance between two points in the same $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}$ square is: $$\sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.$$
