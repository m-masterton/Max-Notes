___

The **CU (Control Unit)** controls the operation of the [[CPU (Central Processing Unit)|CPU]]. It has three main jobs:
1. It manages the buses, controlling the flow of data around the CPU
2. It controls the flow of data between the CPU and other components
3. It executes the instructions provided by a program. It does this by accepting the next instruction, decoding it into several sequential steps (e.g. fetching addresses/data from memory, doing calculations), manages its execution and stores the resulting data back in memory or registers.

The collection of instructions that can be carried out by the CU is called the **instruction set** of the CU.
