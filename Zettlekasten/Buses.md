A **bus** is a set of parallel wires connecting together 2 or more components of a computer. It typically consists of 8, 16, 32 or 64 lines. There are three main buses that are used to manage the flow of data around the computer.

When the [[CPU (Central Processing Unit)|CPU]] wishes to access a particular memory location, it sends the address to the memory on the **address bus**. The data in that location is then returned using the **data bus**. Control signals are sent using the **control bus**. These three buses together are known as the **system bus**

Each bus is a shared transmission medium, so only one device can transmit along a bus at any one time.
