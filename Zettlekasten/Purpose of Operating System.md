___

An **operating system** is a piece of software that manages the computer's operation and allows the user to interface with the computer system. Well known examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android. 

The operating system is held in secondary storage, for example on a hard drive. A small program called a **loader** is held in ROM. When a computer powers on, the loader sends instructions to boot up the operating system by copying it into RAM.

Operating systems need to:
+ Manage and control the hardware of the computer system
+ Manage software and facilitate programs to communicate with the [[CPU (Central Processing Unit)]]
