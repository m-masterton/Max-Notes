The **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is an important part of a computer system often called the "brain of the computer". It processes information, do calculations and execute instructions according to instructions provided by a computer program. It also sends signals to control all the other components of the computer system such as the secondary storage or GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).

The CPU is a very complicated chip which is made up billions of transistors. The CPU has a number of subcomponents which enable it to carry it out is job efficiently. Some of the most important parts are:
+ The Control Unit (CU)
+ The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
+ The Registers
+ Buses

As you can see from the diagram above, there are three main buses that connect all of the parts together. They are:
+ The Data Bus (carries all of the data)
+ The Address Bus (carries information on the location of the data)
+ The Control Bus (carries commands to other devices such as the secondary storage and I/O interface)
