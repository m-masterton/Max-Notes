There are lots of different types of operating systems, some of the ones featured here are:

>[!defi] Definition (Multi-Tasking Operating System)
>A **Multi-Tasking Operating System** allows more than one program to run at the same time - or at least appear to run concurrently to the user by switching between processes from different applications extremely quickly. Most personal computers use this kind of operating system, common examples include Windows, macOS, Linux and Android.

>[!defi] Definition (Multi-User Operating System)
>A **Multi-User Operating System** is an operating system which allows multiple users, on different workstations, to access a single powerful computer via a network. This central computer, often a mainframe / super-computer, contains the operating system which is used on all the connected terminals.

>[!defi] Definition (Distributed Operating System)
>A **Distributed Operating System** controls a number of computers at the same time in order to undertake a single computer-intensive task. Each computer contains part of the overall operating system. Together the group of computers form a **cluster**.

>[!defi] Definition (Real Time Operating System)
>A **Real Time Operating System** (often referred to as a **RTOS**) is designed to handle input data within a guaranteed time (called its latency). It is designed to be extremely reliable and to have very precise and consistent timings. If multiple inputs arrive at the exact same time, the RTOS programmer is able to assign them priorities, so that the most important ones can be handled first using [[Interrupts and Polling|priority interrupts]]. It is designed for use in situations such as:
>1. Factory production lines where robots need to be synchronous and controlled with very specific timings
>2. Car engine management units where thousands of inputs are received per second and response to inputs must be timely
>3. A washing machine where the wash cycle must be conducted properly and precisley.
>

>[!defi] Definition (Embedded Operating System)
>An **Embedded Operating System** is an operating system on an embedded device that is designed to handle a very specific task. For example computers in the following systems:
>1. Cash Machines
>2. Cars
>3. Smart Televisions
>4. Industrial Equipment
