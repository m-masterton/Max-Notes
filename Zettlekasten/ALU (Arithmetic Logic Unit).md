The **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** processes data in the [[CPU (Central Processing Unit)|CPU]]. It can do two different types of processing:
1. **Arithmetic Operations** - it performs standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on fixed point numbers. (Note that the ALU can not work with floating point numbers). It can also perform shift operation, shifting bits to the left or right within a register.
2. **Logic Operations** - it deals with logic and comparisons such as 'is this value greater than this other value' or 'is this value equal to this other value'. It can also process operations such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR.

The result can be stored anywhere in memory with the relevant command. Generally, the result tends to be stored in the accumulator register.
